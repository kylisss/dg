> 中国政府在 “清零” 阶段用不受限制的权力控制国家，但在资源几乎耗尽后，随着疫情席卷全国，当局却消失了。危机时刻缺乏方向让公众对中共的合法性和可信度产生了怀疑。

In its single-minded pursuit of the “zero Covid” strategy, the Chinese government was omnipresent and omnipotent, using its unlimited resources and unchecked power to control the nation. After having nearly exhausted its resources and the good will of the public, the government has now simply disappeared, just as many Chinese are getting very ill with the virus or dying from it.

在一心实施 “清零” 战略的过程中，中国政府仿佛无所不在、无所不能，用无限的资源和不受限制的权力来控制国家。在几乎耗尽资源和公众的善意之后，在许多中国人感染这种病毒而出现重症或因此而死亡时，政府却消失了。

For much of this year, Yang, an engineer in Shenzhen, took Covid tests nearly every day, from one of the more than 40 government-built booths in his neighborhood. Whenever he missed one, he would get text reminders from his district. After buying pain relief medication, he got calls from three different community workers because the state had strict rules about the sale of such over-the-counter drugs.

在今年的大部分时间里，在深圳当工程师的杨先生几乎每天都要在他家附近政府设立的 40 多个检测站中的一个进行核酸检测。每错过一次，他都会收到他所在区的短信提醒。在买了止痛药后，他接到了三个不同社区工作人员的电话，因为国家对这种非处方药的销售有严格的规定。

Since the Chinese leadership abruptly [放弃](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/world/asia/china-zero-covid-protests.html?>abandoned</a> its stringent “zero Covid” policy several weeks ago, Mr. Yang has rarely heard from the government.</p><p>自中国领导层几周前突然<a href=)严格的 “清零” 政策以来，杨先生很少听到来自政府的消息。

“No one is in charge now,” said Mr. Yang, who asked to be identified only by his surname because of safety concerns. His daughter’s school was still open last week even though most students were staying home, either because they were ill or worried about getting sick. There’s no national mask mandate. People with mild symptoms are showing up at work because no one bothers to check in on them anymore. Medicines are in short supply, so Mr. Yang is sharing what he has with friends. His family has four rapid test kits, which are being saved until they’re really needed.

“现在没人管了，” 杨先生说。出于安全考虑，他要求只透露自己的姓。他女儿的学校上周仍在上课，尽管大多数学生都呆在家里，要么是因为生病了，要么是因为担心生病。国家不再强制戴口罩。有轻微症状的人会出现在工作场所，因为再也没有人关心他们的身体情况了。药品短缺，所以杨先生把药品分给朋友们。他的家里有四份快速检测试剂盒，是留到关键时刻的。

自 “清零” 政策被放弃以来，感染病例上升，但尚不清楚确切的上升数字。 Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times

For a powerful government that likes to brag about its command of the country and has published a four-volume compilation of speeches and articles by its top leader titled “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,” the absence of direction at a moment of crisis has made the public question the legitimacy and the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party.

对于一个喜欢吹嘘对国家的掌控，并出版了最高领导人四卷本讲话和文章汇编《习近平谈治国理政》的强大政府来说，在危机时刻没有方向，使公众对中国共产党的合法性和可信度产生了怀疑。

It also highlights a crucial but not always obvious distinction in leadership.

它还突显了领导力中一个至关重要但并不总是很明显的区别。

“The ability to control is different from the ability to govern,” [Chen Tianyong](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/china-entrepreneurs-confidence.html), an entrepreneur, wrote on his social media WeChat timeline last week.

“管控能力不等于社会治理能力，” 企业家[陈天庸](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20190224/china-entrepreneurs-confidence/)上周在微信朋友圈写道。

Xu Kaizhen, a best-selling author famous for novels that explore the intricate workings of China’s bureaucratic politics, wrote on his verified Weibo account that the abrupt change made it abundantly clear “what our government will do, what it likes to do, what it can do, what it doesn’t like to do, what it can’t do and what it doesn’t want to do.”

以探索中国官僚政治复杂运作的小说而闻名的畅销书作家许开祯在他的认证微博账户上写道，这种突然的变化非常清楚地表明，“我们的政府究竟会干什么爱干什么能干什么不爱干什么不会干什么不愿干什么。”

If [good governance](https://www.ohchr.org/en/good-governance/about-good-governance) is about transparency, responsibility, accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the people, the Chinese government has barely practiced it, either in its harsh “zero Covid” policy, or in its haphazard reopening.

如果说[善治](https://www.ohchr.org/en/good-governance/about-good-governance)意味着透明、负责、问责和对人民需求的回应，那么中国政府几乎没有践行这一点，无论是在严厉的 “清零” 政策中，还是在杂乱无章的重新开放中。

It could have spent its resources on increasing vaccine coverage among older people and adding I.C.U. beds. Instead, it spent money on mass Covid testing and building enormous quarantine camps.

它本可以把资源花在提高老年人的疫苗覆盖率和增加重症监护室床位上。然而，它把钱花在了大规模的新冠检测和建造巨大的方舱上。

It could have communicated scientific facts about symptoms and death rates of the Omicron variant. Instead, it fanned fears about Covid.

它本可以传达关于奥密克戎变种的症状和死亡率的科学事实。然而，它煽动人们对新冠的恐惧。

It could have stocked up on fever medicines and provided the public with the best vaccines available. Instead, it made it extremely difficult for people to buy antipyretics and didn’t approve the public use of foreign mRNA vaccines, which have proven more effective than the Chinese ones in preventing severe symptoms.

它本可以储备退烧药，并向公众提供最好的疫苗。然而，它让人们很难买到退烧药，并且没有批准公众使用国外的 mRNA 疫苗，这些疫苗已经被证明在预防重症方面比中国的疫苗更有效。

周二，北京一家药店的货架几乎空无一物。人们在微信上分享富余的发烧药物和新冠病毒检测试剂盒。 Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times

Unlike many governments that took steps to flatten the infection curve before reopening, the Chinese government suddenly let go of nearly all restrictions, most likely an effort to rush an enormous country to herd immunity while leaving the old and vulnerable in precarious situations.

与许多政府在重新开放前采取措施压平感染曲线不同，中国政府突然取消了几乎所有的限制，很可能是为了让一个庞大的国家迅速实现群体免疫，而这会把老年人和弱势群体置于危险境地。

Its main [advice](http://www.news.cn/politics/2022-11/26/c_1129163002.htm) [to the public](http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202212/t20221202_2870649.html): “You’re in charge of your own health.” The slogan has since earlier this year been promoted and repeated by state media and local governments since the reopening.

它对[公众](http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202212/t20221202_2870649.html)的主要[建议](http://www.news.cn/politics/2022-11/26/c_1129163002.htm)是：“每个人都是自己健康的第一责任人。” 自今年早些时候重新开放以来，官方媒体和地方政府一直在宣传和重复这一口号。

But the pandemic is a public health crisis, and such crises are part of the reason governments exist.

但这场大流行是一场公共卫生危机，而这种危机正是政府存在的原因之一。

The change in pandemic control strategy doesn’t mean the government “can sit on its hands,” [Wu Jinglian](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/global/27spy.html), a top Chinese economist known for advocating for smaller government, told the Caixin magazine. It “must avoid going from one extreme to the other.”

以倡导小政府而闻名的中国顶级经济学家[吴敬琏](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/global/27spy.html)在接受《财新》杂志采访时表示，疫情控制策略的变化并不意味着政府 “无所作为”。它 “必须避免从一个极端走向另一个极端”。

Qin Liwen, a former journalist, wrote on her WeChat timeline: “Only when a government does what it’s supposed to do, can the people be responsible for themselves.”

前记者覃里雯在她的微信上写道：“只有政府把该做的做好了，人民才能自己负责自己。”

The local governments haven’t been doing much either. Many officials are probably waiting for guidance from their superiors. “Zero Covid” could be quantified so everyone knew what to do. In a top-down system like the Communist Party, the underlings are often at a loss for what to do when the big boss doesn’t set a goal.

地方政府也没有采取什么措施。许多官员可能在等待上级的指示。“清零” 可以量化，这样每个人都知道该怎么做。在共产党这样一个自上而下的体制下，当上级没有设定目标时，下属往往会不知所措。

For weeks, Mr. Xi said nothing about the end of the country’s “zero Covid” policy, which was considered his [signature campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/09/business/china-covid-zero-xi-jinping.html). On Monday, in his first public comment on the dismantling of “zero Covid,” Mr. Xi was vague, saying that China’s epidemic prevention and control was facing new situations and tasks. He urged the public to “develop good personal hygiene habits” and “practice a civilized and healthy lifestyle.” His remarks didn’t mention either the high infection rates or the death counts.

几周来，习近平对结束中国的 “清零” 政策只字未提，该政策被认为是他的[标志性运动](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20220913/china-covid-zero-xi-jinping/)。周一，在他对取消 “清零” 的首次公开讲话中，习近平含糊其辞，说中国的疫情防控正面临新的形势和任务。他敦促公众“养成良好的个人卫生习惯”，“践行文明健康的生活方式”。他的讲话既没有提到高感染率，也没有提到死亡人数。

It would be wise for the officials to wait for his directive. But the public can’t wait.

Emotions are running high as millions of people are becoming infected every day, leaving pharmacy shelves empty, medical workers overwhelmed and morgues full.

群情激愤，因为每天都有数百万人被感染，药店货架空空如也，医务人员不堪重负，停尸房堆满尸体。

“The virus wasn’t eliminated to zero,” a recent Weibo comment said. “The government’s credibility has been reduced to zero.”

“病毒并没有被清零，” 最近一条微博评论说。“是政府的可信度被清零。”

12 月的北京街景。几乎所有新冠限制措施突然结束，令公众感到不安。 Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times

A widely circulated WeChat [article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZKuXlKzbH7vTV69d-3lpHA) speculated that the shortage of fever medications reflected the government’s lack of preparation for loosening control. And if the government had shown the same political will that it had in implementing “zero Covid,” the article argued, it could have ensured there was ample supply of such medication.

微信上一篇广为流传的[文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZKuXlKzbH7vTV69d-3lpHA)推测，发烧药物的短缺反映了政府对放松管制缺乏准备。文章认为，如果政府表现出跟实施 “清零” 同样的政治意愿，本可以确保这种药物的充足供应。

“It doesn’t care about the ordinary people, leaving them to fend for themselves and even delighting in their chaos,” the article said, and it urged officials to show up where the public most needed them to win back trust.

文章说，“对老百姓不管不顾，任由自生自灭，甚至抱着看笑话的心理放任自流。” 文章敦促官员出现在公众最需要他们的地方，以赢回信任。

The low confidence in the government is forcing people to help themselves and help one another. In local WeChat groups, people made arrangements to share their fever medicines and rapid test kits with their neighbors.

对政府没有信心迫使人们自助和互相帮助。在本地微信群中，人们与邻居分享退烧药和快速检测试剂盒。

Tencent, the social media giant, also built a WeChat program where people could ask for medications from strangers with extra. The help requests are modest: six tablets of acetaminophen; four tablets of ibuprofen; two rapid test kits; one thermometer.

社交媒体巨头腾讯也建立了一个微信项目，帮助人们向有富余药物的陌生人寻求帮助。要求并不高：六片对乙酰氨基酚；四片布洛芬；两套快速检测试剂盒；一个温度计。

They are asking strangers for help because they’re not getting it from their government.

他们向陌生人寻求帮助，因为他们无法从政府那里得到帮助。

“Don’t expect anything from Leviathan — there’s no point in appealing, either,” Chen Min, a former journalist better known by his pen name, Xiao Shu, wrote on his WeChat timeline, referring to the central government. “In the end, we have to help ourselves.”

笔名 “笑蜀” 的前记者陈敏在微信上写道：“对利维坦就不要有任何指望了。呼吁也没有意义。”利维坦指的是中央政府。“归根结底还是靠自救。”

Only by building an extensive network of social connections, he continued, “can we weave a real social safety net in the darkest moment, build a real Noah’s ark and save countless lives.”

他还说，只有建立一个广泛的社会横向联系，“才能在至暗时刻编织出真正的社会安全网，打造出真正的诺亚方舟，拯救无数生灵。”

This is exactly the type of governance crisis about which Mr. Xi had once warned the party.

“It is not up to us to judge our party’s governance capacity or performance; they must and can only be judged by the people,” Mr. Xi said in a speech in 2013. “If we are pretentious and divorce ourselves from the people or put ourselves above them, we will surely be abandoned by them. This is the case for any party, and is an iron law which admits of no exception.”

“我们党的执政水平和执政成效都不是由自己说了算，必须而且只能由人民来评判，” 习近平在 2013 年的一次讲话中说。“人民是我们党的工作的最高裁决者和最终评判者。如果自诩高明、脱离了人民，或者凌驾于人民之上，就必将被人民所抛弃。任何政党都是如此，这是历史发展的铁律，古今中外概莫能外。”
